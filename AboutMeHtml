  	My name is Jacqueline Chin and I am 17 years old. I was born in Miami, FL. Currently, I am attending
Archimedean Upper Conservatory. I am a rising senior and I hope to attend Boston University or Rice
University in the fall of 2018. I am interested in studying biomedical engineering and eventually becoming
a doctor.
 My favorite thing to do would be to travel. If i could just spend my time traveling i would.
I enjoy going to new places and seeing landmarks that make each place unique. I also enjoy
photography.
